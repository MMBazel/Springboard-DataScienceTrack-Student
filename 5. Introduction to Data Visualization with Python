---------Customizing Plots---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plotting multiple graphs
Strategies:

  -Plotting many graphs on a common axis
  -Creating axes within a figure
  -Creating subplots within a figure
  
  
Ex:
		import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		plt.plot(t,temperature,'r')
		plt.plot(t,dewpoint,'b') #Appears on same axes
	plt.xlabel('Date')
		plt.title('Temperature & Dew Point')
		plt.show() #Renders plot objects t screen

Using axes
	Laying figures out with separate axes side by side

			plt.axes([0.05,0.05,0.425,0.9])
			plt.plot(t,temperature,'r')
			plt.xlabel('Date')
			plt.title('Temperature')
			plt.axes([0.05,0.05,0.425,0.9])
			plt.plot(t, dewpoint,'b')
			plt.xlabel('Date')
			plt.title('Dew Point')
			plt.show()

					
The axes() command
	-Syntx: axes([x_lo, y_lo, width, height])
	-Units between 0 and 1 (figure dimensions)
					
Using subplot()
	Ex: for the 2 graphs in top of eah other
	
			plt.subplot(2,1,1)
			plt.plot(t,temperature,'r')
			plt.xlabel('Date')
			plt.title('Temperature')
			plt.subplot(2,1,2)
			plt.plot(t, dewpoint,'b')
			plt.xlabel('Date')
			plt.title('Dew Point')
			plt.tight_layout()
					
					
The subplot()command
	-Syntax: subplot(nrows, ncols, nsubplot)
	-Subplot ordering:
		-Row-wise from top left
		-Indexed from 1

  Multiple plots on single axis
It is time now to put together some of what you have learned and combine line plots on a common set of axes. The data set here comes from records of undergraduate degrees awarded to women in a variety of fields from 1970 to 2011. You can compare trends in degrees most easily by viewing two curves on the same set of axes.

Here, three NumPy arrays have been pre-loaded for you: year (enumerating years from 1970 to 2011 inclusive), physical_sciences (representing the percentage of Physical Sciences degrees awarded to women each in corresponding year), and computer_science (representing the percentage of Computer Science degrees awarded to women in each corresponding year).

You will issue two plt.plot() commands to draw line plots of different colors on the same set of axes. Here, year represents the x-axis, while physical_sciences and computer_science are the y-axes.

INSTRUCTIONS

Import matplotlib.pyplot as its usual alias.
Add a 'blue' line plot of the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences (physical_sciences) from 1970 to 2011 (year). Note that the x-axis should be specified first.
Add a 'red' line plot of the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science (computer_science) from 1970 to 2011 (year).
Use plt.show() to display the figure with the curves on the same axes.


  
  
  # Import matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color = 'blue')

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color = 'red')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

 Using axes()
Rather than overlaying line plots on common axes, you may prefer to plot different line plots on distinct axes. The command plt.axes() is one way to do this (but it requires specifying coordinates relative to the size of the figure).

Here, you have the same three arrays year, physical_sciences, and computer_science representing percentages of degrees awarded to women over a range of years. You will use plt.axes() to create separate sets of axes in which you will draw each line plot.

In calling plt.axes([xlo, ylo, width, height]), a set of axes is created and made active with lower corner at coordinates (xlo, ylo) of the specified width and height. Note that these coordinates can be passed to plt.axes() in the form of a list or a tuple.

The coordinates and lengths are values between 0 and 1 representing lengths relative to the dimensions of the figure. After issuing a plt.axes() command, plots generated are put in that set of axes.

Create a set of plot axes with lower corner xlo and ylo of 0.05 and 0.05, width of 0.425, and height of 0.9 (in units relative to the figure dimension).
Note: Remember to pass these coordinates to plt.axes() in the form of a list: [xlo, ylo, width, height].
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences in blue in the active axes just created.
Create a set of plot axes with lower corner xlo and ylo of 0.525 and 0.05, width of 0.425, and height of 0.9 (in units relative to the figure dimension).
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science in red in the active axes just created.
  
  
  # Create plot axes for the first line plot
plt.axes([0.05, 0.05, 0.425, 0.9])

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')

# Create plot axes for the second line plot
plt.axes([0.525, 0.05, 0.425, 0.9])

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red')


# Display the plot
plt.show()

Using subplot() (1)
The command plt.axes() requires a lot of effort to use well because the coordinates of the axes need to be set manually. A better alternative is to use plt.subplot() to determine the layout automatically.

In this exercise, you will continue working with the same arrays from the previous exercises: year, physical_sciences, and computer_science. Rather than using plt.axes() to explicitly lay out the axes, you will use plt.subplot(m, n, k) to make the subplot grid of dimensions m by n and to make the kth subplot active (subplots are numbered starting from 1 row-wise from the top left corner of the subplot grid).

INSTRUCTIONS

Use plt.subplot() to create a figure with 1x2 subplot layout & make the first subplot active.
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences in blue in the active subplot.
Use plt.subplot() again to make the second subplot active in the current 1x2 subplot grid.
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science in red in the active subplot.



# Create a figure with 1x2 subplot and make the left subplot active
plt.subplot(1,2,1)

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')
plt.title('Physical Sciences')

# Make the right subplot active in the current 1x2 subplot grid
plt.subplot(1,2,2)

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red')
plt.title('Computer Science')

# Use plt.tight_layout() to improve the spacing between subplots
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

  Using subplot() (2)
Now you have some familiarity with plt.subplot(), you can use it to plot more plots in larger grids of subplots of the same figure.

Here, you will make a 2×2 grid of subplots and plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences (using physical_sciences), in Computer Science (using computer_science), in Health Professions (using health), and in Education (using education).

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Create a figure with 2×2 subplot layout, make the top, left subplot active, and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences in blue in the active subplot.
Make the top, right subplot active in the current 2×2 subplot grid and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science in red in the active subplot.
Make the bottom, left subplot active in the current 2×2 subplot grid and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Health Professions in green in the active subplot.
Make the bottom, right subplot active in the current 2×2 subplot grid and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Education in yellow in the active subplot.


# Create a figure with 2x2 subplot layout and make the top left subplot active
plt.subplot(2,2,1)

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')
plt.title('Physical Sciences')

# Make the top right subplot active in the current 2x2 subplot grid 
plt.subplot(2,2,2)

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red')
plt.title('Computer Science')

# Make the bottom left subplot active in the current 2x2 subplot grid
plt.subplot(2,2,3)

# Plot in green the % of degrees awarded to women in Health Professions
plt.plot(year, health, color='green')
plt.title('Health Professions')

# Make the bottom right subplot active in the current 2x2 subplot grid
plt.subplot(2,2,4)


# Plot in yellow the % of degrees awarded to women in Education
plt.plot(year, education, color='yellow')
plt.title('Education')

# Improve the spacing between subplots and display them
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Customizing axes:

Controlling axis extents -- sa you want to zoom in on a part

		-axis([xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]) sets axis elements
		-Control over individual axis extents
			-xlim([xmin, xmax])
			-ylim([ymin, ymax])
		-Can use tuples, lists for extents
			e.g. xlim((-2,3)) works
			e.g. xlim([-2,3]) works also
			
			
GDP over time

		import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		plt.plot(yr, gdp)
		plt.xlabel('Year')
		plt.ylabel('Billions of Doollars')
		plt.title('US Gross Domestic product')
		plt.show()
