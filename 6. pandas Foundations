Pandas DataFrames are the most widely used in-memory representation of complex data collections within Python. Whether in finance, scientific fields, or data science, a familiarity with Pandas is essential. This course teaches you to work with real-world data sets containing both string and numeric data, often structured around time series. You will learn powerful analysis, selection, and visualization techniques in this course.

Data ingestion & inspection

Review of pandas Data Frames
    -pandas is for data analysis
    -power tool of pandas is DataFrame - tabular data sgtructure with labeled rows & columns
      -rows are labeled by Index- special data structure
        -indexes are tailored lists of labels that permit fast look-up & powerful relational operations
        
      
    ex: 
          import pandas as pd  ###AAPL is an example Pandas DataFrame 
          type(AAPL)  ### Gives # of rows and # of columns as tuple
          AAPL.shape
          AAPL.columns ###List the name of the columns
          
Pandas DataFRames can be sliced like NumPy arrays or Python lists using colons to specify the start, end and stride of a slice
          We can slice using the .iloc accessor to express the slice positionally

        ex: 
        
            AAPL.iloc[:5,:]
            AAPL.iloc[-5:,:]   ###Next we can slice from the 5th last row to the end of the DataFrame using a negative index
            
            ### Also possible to slice using labels with the .loc accessor
            
 head()
        Another way to see just the top rows of a DataFrame: the head method
        Specifying head(5) returns the first 5 rows
        
            AAPL.head(5)
        
tail()   

        AAPL.tail()   - default is 5
        
info()

        AAPL.info() - returns the metadata
        
        
 Broadcasting
 
        import numpy as np
        AAPL.iloc[::3,-1] = mp.nan     ###  <=== Assigning scalar value to column slice broadcasts value to each row (like NaN in this case)
        AAPL.head(6)   
      
                ### Slice consists of every 3rd row starting from zero in the last column
                
                
Series
    Columns of a DataFrame are themselves a specialized Pandas structure called a Series
    Extracting a single column from Pandas returns a Series
    Notice the Series extracted has its own head() method and inherits its name attribute from the DataFrame column
    
            low = AAPL['Low']
            type(low)
            low.head()
            lows = low.values
            type(lows)
                
    To extract the numerical entries from the Series, use the values attribute
    The data in the Series actually form a Numpy Array which is what the values attribute yields
    A pandas Series, then, is a 1D labelled NumPy array and a DataFrame is a 2D labelled array whose columns are Series
    ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    
    
DataFrame data types
Pandas is aware of the data types in the columns of your DataFrame. It is also aware of null and NaN ('Not-a-Number') types which often indicate missing data. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and read in the world population data which contains some NaN values, a value often used as a place-holder for missing or otherwise invalid data entries. Your job is to use df.info() to determine information about the total count of non-null entries and infer the total count of 'null' entries, which likely indicates missing data. Select the best description of this data set from the following:

NumPy and pandas working together
Pandas depends upon and interoperates with NumPy, the Python library for fast numeric array computations. For example, you can use the DataFrame attribute .values to represent a DataFrame df as a NumPy array. You can also pass pandas data structures to NumPy methods. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and loaded world population data every 10 years since 1960 into the DataFrame df. This dataset was derived from the one used in the previous exercise.

Your job is to extract the values and store them in an array using the attribute .values. You'll then use those values as input into the NumPy np.log10() method to compute the base 10 logarithm of the population values. Finally, you will pass the entire pandas DataFrame into the same NumPy np.log10() method and compare the results.

Import numpy using the standard alias np.
Assign the numerical values in the DataFrame df to an array np_vals using the attribute values.
Pass np_vals into the NumPy method log10() and store the results in np_vals_log10.
Pass the entire df DataFrame into the NumPy method log10() and store the results in df_log10.
Inspect the output of the print() code to see the type() of the variables that you created.

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array of DataFrame values: np_vals
np_vals = df.values

# Create new array of base 10 logarithm values: np_vals_log10
np_vals_log10 = np.log10(np_vals)

# Create array of new DataFrame by passing df to np.log10(): df_log10
df_log10 = np.log10(df)

# Print original and new data containers
[print(x, 'has type', type(eval(x))) for x in ['np_vals', 'np_vals_log10', 'df', 'df_log10']]

Building DataFrames from Scratch

        -We've seen how to work with DataFrames in memory but how do we get them in memory?
        
  DataFrames from CSV files
        - In prior course, we used read_csv to load a DataFrame from a csv file
        

        -Example: Here we use a file users.csv to create a DataFrame called users
                    The file records visitors to a blog for a band and who signed up for the newsletter.
                    By tracking where visitors come from, this information can help design tours later. 
                    DataFrames can also be rolled by hand using dictionaries.
        
                import pandas as pd
                users = pd.read_csv('datasets/users.csv', index_col=0)
                print(users)

DataFrames from dict(1)
        -DataFrames can also be rolled by hand using dictionaries
        -Dictionaries (or associative arrays) are a core data structure in Python
            -Here we construct a dictionary of lists with the same users data
            Keys of dictionary data are used as column labels
            Notice with no index specified, the row labels are the integers zero to three by default
            
                        import pandas as pd
                        data = {'weekyday': ['Sun', 'Sun', 'Mon', 'Mon],
                                'city': ['Austin', 'Dallas', 'Austin', 'Dallas'],
                                'visitors':[139,237,326,456],
                                'singups':[7,12,3,5]}
                                
                         users = pd.DataFrame(data)       
        

DataFrames from dict(2)
    import pandas as pd
    
    ### Common for data to come in form of lists
    cities = ['Austin','Dallas','Austin','Dallas']
    signups = [7, 12, 3, 5]
    visitors = [139,237,326,456]
    weekdays = ['Sun', 'Sun', 'Mon', 'Mon]

    
    ###Can then define other lists: list_labels  & list cols
    
    list_labels = ['city', 'signups', 'visitors', 'weekday']
    list_cols = [cities, signups, visitors, weekdays]   ###<= Notice this is a list of lists
    
    zipped = list(zip(list_labels, list_cols))  ###Using pyton's list and zip functions constructus a list called zipped of tupls (column names and columns) to feed to the dict command. 
    
    ### Calling dict(zipped) creates a dict data which is then used with pd.DataFrame to build the DataFrame
    data = dict(zipped)
    users = pd.DataFRame(data)
    
    
Broadcasting

        -a convenient technique in NumPy & Pandas
        -with users in memory, a new colun, can be created on the fly 
        -Broadcasting saves time in generating long lists, arrays, or columns
    
    users['fees'] = 0 ### New columns fees is created and value = 0 is broadcast to entire column
    
    
    
Broadcasting with a dict
        -Broadcasting isn;t restricted to numbers
        -Here we create a dictionary data with column lables height and sex as keys and a list and a single-character string 'M' as values
        -When the dict data is used to create DataFrame results, the value 'M' is broadcast to the entire column
        
        
        import pandas as pd
        heights = [59.0, 65.2, 62.9, 65.4, 63.7, 65.7, 64.1]
        data = {'height':heights, 'sex':'M'}
        results = pd.DataFrame(data)
        
Index and Columns

        Remember we can change the column and index labels using the columns and index attributes of a Pandas DataFrame
        We can assign lists of strings to the attributes columns and index as long as they are of suitable length (that is, the number of columns and rows respectively)
        
        
                results.columns = ['height (in)', 'sex']
                results.index = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']

Zip lists to build a DataFrame
In this exercise, you're going to make a pandas DataFrame of the top three countries to win gold medals since 1896 by first building a dictionary. list_keys contains the column names 'Country' and 'Total'. list_values contains the full names of each country and the number of gold medals awarded. The values have been taken from Wikipedia.

Your job is to use these lists to construct a list of tuples, use the list of tuples to construct a dictionary, and then use that dictionary to construct a DataFrame. In doing so, you'll make use of the list(), zip(), dict() and pd.DataFrame() functions. Pandas has already been imported as pd.

Note: The zip() function in Python 3 and above returns a special zip object, which is essentially a generator. To convert this zip object into a list, you'll need to use list(). You can learn more about the zip() function as well as generators in Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2).

Zip the 2 lists list_keys and list_values together into one list of (key, value) tuples. Be sure to convert the zip object into a list, and store the result in zipped.
Inspect the contents of zipped using print(). This has been done for you.
Construct a dictionary using zipped. Store the result as data.
Construct a DataFrame using the dictionary. Store the result as df.

# Zip the 2 lists together into one list of (key,value) tuples: zipped
zipped = list(zip(list_keys, list_values))

# Inspect the list using print()
print(zipped)

# Build a dictionary with the zipped list: data
data = dict(zipped)

# Build and inspect a DataFrame from the dictionary: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-

Labeling your data
You can use the DataFrame attribute df.columns to view and assign new string labels to columns in a pandas DataFrame.

In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and defined a DataFrame df containing top Billboard hits from the 1980s (from Wikipedia). Each row has the year, artist, song name and the number of weeks at the top. However, this DataFrame has the column labels a, b, c, d. Your job is to use the df.columns attribute to re-assign descriptive column labels.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a list of new column labels with 'year', 'artist', 'song', 'chart weeks', and assign it to list_labels.
Assign your list of labels to df.columns.

# Build a list of labels: list_labels
list_labels = ['year', 'artist', 'song', 'chart weeks']

# Assign the list of labels to the columns attribute: df.columns
df.columns = list_labels

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Building DataFrames with broadcasting
You can implicitly use 'broadcasting', a feature of NumPy, when creating pandas DataFrames. In this exercise, you're going to create a DataFrame of cities in Pennsylvania that contains the city name in one column and the state name in the second. We have imported the names of 15 cities as the list cities.

Your job is to construct a DataFrame from the list of cities and the string 'PA'.

Instructions
100 XP
Make a string object with the value 'PA' and assign it to state.
Construct a dictionary with 2 key:value pairs: 'state':state and 'city':cities.
Construct a pandas DataFrame from the dictionary you created and assign it to df.

# Make a string with the value 'PA': state
state = 'PA'

# Construct a dictionary: data
data = {'state':state, 'city':cities}

# Construct a DataFrame from dictionary data: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)

Importing  &  Exporting Data

dataSets from CSV files
    Read csv functions requires a string describing a filepath as input
    We read into a DataFrame sunspots
    Notuce the index of the DataFra,e (the row labales) are of a type Range Index (just integers)
    
    
        import pandas as pd
        filepath = 'ISSN_D_tot.csv'
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath)
        sunspots.info()
        sunspots.iloc[10:20,:]       #### Using the accessor.iloc to view a slice of the middle of the DataFrame
    

Example data set: SILSO sunspots data set

    Problems 
        CSV file has no column headers
        Missing values
        As written, dates are awakward for CSV files
        
      
      
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None)  ###Using header =None prevents pandas from assuming the first line of the file gives column labels
        
        
Using names keyword     
        
        We can explicitly define the column names using the names keyword
        
        col_names = ['year', 'month', 'day', 'dec_date', 'sunspots', 'definite']
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None, names=col_names)
        sunspots.iloc[10:20,:]
 
 
 Using na_values keyword(1)
 
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None, names=col_names, na_values='-1')  ## We try na_values equals "-1" but in this case will need " -1" 
        sunspots.iloc[10:20,:]
        
        
        We can also read the negative one entries in the sunspots with the na_values keyword
        
        
 Using na_values keyword(3) 
        Note it's possible using distinct patterns for null values & multipl values
        
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None, names = col_names, na_values={'sunspots':['-1']})
        
        
        
Using  parse_date keyword  
        The prase_dates keyword in read_csv infers dates intelligently
        We use a list of lists of column positons (indexed from 0) to inform read_csv which columns hold the dates
        
        sunspots = pd.read_csv(filepath, header=None, names=col_names, na_values={'sunspots':['-1]}, parse_dates=[[0,1,2]]) ### This combines three columns (month, day, year)
        
        
        
Trimming redundant columns
        Only include meaningful columns

Reading a flat file
In previous exercises, we have preloaded the data for you using the pandas function read_csv(). Now, it's your turn! Your job is to read the World Bank population data you saw earlier into a DataFrame using read_csv(). The file is available in the variable data_file.

The next step is to reread the same file, but simultaneously rename the columns using the names keyword input parameter, set equal to a list of new column labels. You will also need to set header=0 to rename the column labels.

Finish up by inspecting the result with df.head() and df.info() in the IPython Shell (changing df to the name of your DataFrame variable).

pandas has already been imported and is available in the workspace as pd.

Instructions
100 XP
Use pd.read_csv() with the string data_file to read the CSV file into a DataFrame and assign it to df1.
Create a list of new column labels - 'year', 'population' - and assign it to the variable new_labels.
Reread the same file, again using pd.read_csv(), but this time, add the keyword arguments header=0 and names=new_labels. Assign the resulting DataFrame to df2.
Print both the df1 and df2 DataFrames to see the change in column names. This has already been done for you.

# Read in the file: df1
df1 = pd.read_csv(data_file)

# Create a list of the new column labels: new_labels
new_labels = ['year','population']

# Read in the file, specifying the header and names parameters: df2
df2 = pd.read_csv(data_file, header=0, names=new_labels)

# Print both the DataFrames
print(df1)
print(df2)

Delimiters, headers, and extensions
Not all data files are clean and tidy. Pandas provides methods for reading those not-so-perfect data files that you encounter far too often.

In this exercise, you have monthly stock data for four companies downloaded from Yahoo Finance. The data is stored as one row for each company and each column is the end-of-month closing price. The file name is given to you in the variable file_messy.

In addition, this file has three aspects that may cause trouble for lesser tools: multiple header lines, comment records (rows) interleaved throughout the data rows, and space delimiters instead of commas.

Your job is to use pandas to read the data from this problematic file_messy using non-default input options with read_csv() so as to tidy up the mess at read time. Then, write the cleaned up data to a CSV file with the variable file_clean that has been prepared for you, as you might do in a real data workflow.

You can learn about the option input parameters needed by using help() on the pandas function pd.read_csv().

Use pd.read_csv() without using any keyword arguments to read file_messy into a pandas DataFrame df1.
Use .head() to print the first 5 rows of df1 and see how messy it is. Do this in the IPython Shell first so you can see how modifying read_csv() can clean up this mess.
Using the keyword arguments delimiter=' ', header=3 and comment='#', use pd.read_csv() again to read file_messy into a new DataFrame df2.
Print the output of df2.head() to verify the file was read correctly.
Use the DataFrame method .to_csv() to save the DataFrame df2 to the variable file_clean. Be sure to specify index=False.
Use the DataFrame method .to_excel() to save the DataFrame df2 to the file 'file_clean.xlsx'. Again, remember to specify index=False.


# Read the raw file as-is: df1
df1 = pd.read_csv(file_messy)

# Print the output of df1.head()
print(df1.head())

# Read in the file with the correct parameters: df2
df2 = pd.read_csv(file_messy, delimiter=' ', header=3, comment='#')

# Print the output of df2.head()
print(df2.head())

# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to a CSV file without the index
df2.to_csv(file_clean, index=False)

# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to an excel file without the index
df2.to_excel('file_clean.xlsx', index=False)

Plotting with Pandas


AAPL Stock Data
    
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    aapl = pd.read_csv('aapl.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=True)  ###Notice the options parse_date = True & index_col='date' to force a datetime64 index
    aapl.head(6)
    
    
Plotting arrays (matplotlib)

    close_arr = aapl['close'].values   ###Now we assign close_arr by indexing aapl 'close' (yielding a Series) and applying the values method (yielding a NumPy array) 
    type(close_arr)                                    #### Remember the command plot can plot NumPy arrays or lists & the command show must be executed to make the plot visible
    numpy.ndarray

    plt.plot(close_arr)
    plt.show() 
    

We can plot a Pandas series directly

    close_series = aapl['close']
    type(close_series)  ### displays that in this case it's a pandas Series
    plt.plot(close_series)  ###Plot automatically uses tje Serie's datetime index labels along the horizontal axis
    plt.show() 
    

An even nicer method is to plot series (Pandas)

        close_series.plot()  ###Plot series directly
        plt.show()
        
        
 Plotting DataFrames (pandas)
 
        aapl.plot()
        plt.show()

 Plotting series using pandas
Data visualization is often a very effective first step in gaining a rough understanding of a data set to be analyzed. Pandas provides data visualization by both depending upon and interoperating with the matplotlib library. You will now explore some of the basic plotting mechanics with pandas as well as related matplotlib options. We have pre-loaded a pandas DataFrame df which contains the data you need. Your job is to use the DataFrame method df.plot() to visualize the data, and then explore the optional matplotlib input parameters that this .plot() method accepts.

The pandas .plot() method makes calls to matplotlib to construct the plots. This means that you can use the skills you've learned in previous visualization courses to customize the plot. In this exercise, you'll add a custom title and axis labels to the figure.

Before plotting, inspect the DataFrame in the IPython Shell using df.head(). Also, use type(df) and note that it is a single column DataFrame.

Create the plot with the DataFrame method df.plot(). Specify a color of 'red'.
Note: c and color are interchangeable as parameters here, but we ask you to be explicit and specify color.
Use plt.title() to give the plot a title of 'Temperature in Austin'.
Use plt.xlabel() to give the plot an x-axis label of 'Hours since midnight August 1, 2010'.
Use plt.ylabel() to give the plot a y-axis label of 'Temperature (degrees F)'.
Finally, display the plot using plt.show().

# Create a plot with color='red'
df.plot(color='red')

# Add a title
plt.title('Temperature in Austin')

# Specify the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Hours since midnight August 1, 2010')

# Specify the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Temperature (degrees F)')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Plotting DataFrames
Comparing data from several columns can be very illuminating. Pandas makes doing so easy with multi-column DataFrames. By default, calling df.plot() will cause pandas to over-plot all column data, with each column as a single line. In this exercise, we have pre-loaded three columns of data from a weather data set - temperature, dew point, and pressure - but the problem is that pressure has different units of measure. The pressure data, measured in Atmospheres, has a different vertical scaling than that of the other two data columns, which are both measured in degrees Fahrenheit.

Your job is to plot all columns as a multi-line plot, to see the nature of vertical scaling problem. Then, use a list of column names passed into the DataFrame df[column_list] to limit plotting to just one column, and then just 2 columns of data. When you are finished, you will have created 4 plots. You can cycle through them by clicking on the 'Previous Plot' and 'Next Plot' buttons.

As in the previous exercise, inspect the DataFrame df in the IPython Shell using the .head() and .info() methods.

Instructions

Plot all columns together on one figure by calling df.plot(), and noting the vertical scaling problem.
Plot all columns as subplots. To do so, you need to specify subplots=True inside .plot().
Plot a single column of dew point data. To do this, define a column list containing a single column name 'Dew Point (deg F)', and call df[column_list1].plot().
Plot two columns of data, 'Temperature (deg F)' and 'Dew Point (deg F)'. To do this, define a list containing those column names and pass it into df[], as df[column_list2].plot().

# Plot all columns (default)
df.plot()
plt.show()

# Plot all columns as subplots
df.plot(subplots=True)
plt.show()

# Plot just the Dew Point data
column_list1 = ['Dew Point (deg F)']
df[column_list1].plot()
plt.show()

# Plot the Dew Point and Temperature data, but not the Pressure data
column_list2 = ['Temperature (deg F)','Dew Point (deg F)']
df[column_list2].plot()
plt.show()

In the previous chapter, you saw that the .plot() method will place the Index values on the x-axis by default. In this exercise, you'll practice making line plots with specific columns on the x and y axes.

You will work with a dataset consisting of monthly stock prices in 2015 for AAPL, GOOG, and IBM. The stock prices were obtained from Yahoo Finance. Your job is to plot the 'Month' column on the x-axis and the AAPL and IBM prices on the y-axis using a list of column names.

All necessary modules have been imported for you, and the DataFrame is available in the workspace as df. Explore it using methods such as .head(), .info(), and .describe() to see the column names.

Instructions

Create a list of y-axis column names called y_columns consisting of 'AAPL' and 'IBM'.
Generate a line plot with x='Month' and y=y_columns as inputs.
Give the plot a title of 'Monthly stock prices'.
Specify the y-axis label.
Display the plot.


# Create a list of y-axis column names: y_columns
y_columns = ['AAPL', 'IBM']

# Generate a line plot
df.plot(x='Month', y=y_columns)

# Add the title
plt.title('Monthly stock prices')

# Add the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Price ($US)')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

pandas scatter plots
Pandas scatter plots are generated using the kind='scatter' keyword argument. Scatter plots require that the x and y columns be chosen by specifying the x and y parameters inside .plot(). Scatter plots also take an s keyword argument to provide the radius of each circle to plot in pixels.

In this exercise, you're going to plot fuel efficiency (miles-per-gallon) versus horse-power for 392 automobiles manufactured from 1970 to 1982 from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The size of each circle is provided as a NumPy array called sizes. This array contains the normalized 'weight' of each automobile in the dataset.

All necessary modules have been imported and the DataFrame is available in the workspace as df.

Instructions
100 XP
Generate a scatter plot with 'hp' on the x-axis and 'mpg' on the y-axis. Specify s=sizes.
Add a title to the plot.
Specify the x-axis and y-axis labels.



# Generate a scatter plot
df.plot(kind='scatter', x='hp', y='mpg', s=sizes)

# Add the title
plt.title('Fuel efficiency vs Horse-power')

# Add the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Horse-power')

# Add the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Fuel efficiency (mpg)')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

pandas box plots
While pandas can plot multiple columns of data in a single figure, making plots that share the same x and y axes, there are cases where two columns cannot be plotted together because their units do not match. The .plot() method can generate subplots for each column being plotted. Here, each plot will be scaled independently.

In this exercise your job is to generate box plots for fuel efficiency (mpg) and weight from the automobiles data set. To do this in a single figure, you'll specify subplots=True inside .plot() to generate two separate plots.

All necessary modules have been imported and the automobiles dataset is available in the workspace as df.

Instructions
100 XP
Make a list called cols of the column names to be plotted: 'weight' and 'mpg'.
Call plot on df[cols] to generate a box plot of the two columns in a single figure. To do this, specify subplots=True.

# Make a list of the column names to be plotted: cols
cols = ['weight','mpg']

# Generate the box plots
df[cols].plot(kind = 'box', subplots=True)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

pandas hist, pdf and cdf
Pandas relies on the .hist() method to not only generate histograms, but also plots of probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative density functions (CDFs).

In this exercise, you will work with a dataset consisting of restaurant bills that includes the amount customers tipped.

The original dataset is provided by the Seaborn package.

Your job is to plot a PDF and CDF for the fraction column of the tips dataset. This column contains information about what fraction of the total bill is comprised of the tip.

Remember, when plotting the PDF, you need to specify normed=True in your call to .hist(), and when plotting the CDF, you need to specify cumulative=True in addition to normed=True.

All necessary modules have been imported and the tips dataset is available in the workspace as df. Also, some formatting code has been written so that the plots you generate will appear on separate rows.

Instructions

Plot a PDF for the values in fraction with 30 bins between 0 and 30%. The range has been taken care of for you. ax=axes[0] means that this plot will appear in the first row.
Plot a CDF for the values in fraction with 30 bins between 0 and 30%. Again, the range has been specified for you. To make the CDF appear on the second row, you need to specify ax=axes[1].


# This formats the plots such that they appear on separate rows
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1)

# Plot the PDF
df.fraction.plot(ax=axes[0], kind='hist', bins=30, normed=True, range=(0,.3))
plt.show()

# Plot the CDF
df.fraction.plot(ax=axes[1], kind='hist', bins=30, normed=True, cumulative=True, range=(0,.3))
plt.show()

Bachelor's degrees awarded to women
In this exercise, you will investigate statistics of the percentage of Bachelor's degrees awarded to women from 1970 to 2011. Data is recorded every year for 17 different fields. This data set was obtained from the Digest of Education Statistics.

Your job is to compute the minimum and maximum values of the 'Engineering' column and generate a line plot of the mean value of all 17 academic fields per year. To perform this step, you'll use the .mean() method with the keyword argument axis='columns'. This computes the mean across all columns per row.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you as df with the index set to 'Year'.

Instructions

Print the minimum value of the 'Engineering' column.
Print the maximum value of the 'Engineering' column.
Construct the mean percentage per year with .mean(axis='columns'). Assign the result to mean.
Plot the average percentage per year. Since 'Year' is the index of df, it will appear on the x-axis of the plot. No keyword arguments are needed in your call to .plot().


# Print the minimum value of the Engineering column
print(df['Engineering'].min())

# Print the maximum value of the Engineering column
print(df['Engineering'].max())

# Construct the mean percentage per year: mean
mean = df.mean(axis='columns')

# Plot the average percentage per year
mean.plot()

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Median vs mean
In many data sets, there can be large differences in the mean and median value due to the presence of outliers.

In this exercise, you'll investigate the mean, median, and max fare prices paid by passengers on the Titanic and generate a box plot of the fare prices. This data set was obtained from Vanderbilt University.

All necessary modules have been imported and the DataFrame is available in the workspace as df.

Instructions
100 XP
Print summary statistics of the 'fare' column of df with .describe() and print(). Note: df.fare and df['fare'] are equivalent.
Generate a box plot of the 'fare' column.

# Print summary statistics of the fare column with .describe()
print(df.fare.describe())

# Generate a box plot of the fare column
df.fare.plot(kind='box')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


__________________________________________________________________________________________

Quantiles
In this exercise, you'll investigate the probabilities of life expectancy in countries around the world. This dataset contains life expectancy for persons born each year from 1800 to 2015. Since country names change or results are not reported, not every country has values. This dataset was obtained from Gapminder.

First, you will determine the number of countries reported in 2015. There are a total of 260 unique countries in the entire dataset. Then, you will compute the 5th and 95th percentiles of life expectancy over the entire dataset. Finally, you will make a box plot of life expectancy every 50 years from 1800 to 2000. Notice the large change in the distributions over this period.

The dataset has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame called df.

Instructions
100 XP
Print the number of countries reported in 2015. To do this, use the .count() method on the '2015' column of df.
Print the 5th and 95th percentiles of df. To do this, use the .quantile() method with the list [0.05, 0.95].
Generate a box plot using the list of columns provided in years. This has already been done for you, so click on 'Submit Answer' to view the result!

# Print the number of countries reported in 2015

# Generate a box plot
years = ['1800','1850','1900','1950','2000']
df[years].plot(kind='box')
plt.show()

Standard deviation of temperature
Let's use the mean and standard deviation to explore differences in temperature distributions in Pittsburgh in 2013. The data has been obtained from Weather Underground.

In this exercise, you're going to compare the distribution of daily temperatures in January and March. You'll compute the mean and standard deviation for these two months. You will notice that while the mean values are similar, the standard deviations are quite different, meaning that one month had a larger fluctuation in temperature than the other.

The DataFrames have been pre-loaded for you as january, which contains the January data, and march, which contains the March data.

Separating populations with Boolean indexing


Separate and summarize
Let's use population filtering to determine how the automobiles in the US differ from the global average and standard deviation. How does the distribution of fuel efficiency (MPG) for the US differ from the global average and standard deviation?

In this exercise, you'll compute the means and standard deviations of all columns in the full automobile dataset. Next, you'll compute the same quantities for just the US population and subtract the global values from the US values.

All necessary modules have been imported and the DataFrame has been pre-loaded as df.

us_std = us.std()

# Print the differences
print(us_mean - global_mean)
print(us_std - global_std)

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Separate and plot
Population filtering can be used alongside plotting to quickly determine differences in distributions between the sub-populations. You'll work with the Titanic dataset.

There were three passenger classes on the Titanic, and passengers in each class paid a different fare price. In this exercise, you'll investigate the differences in these fare prices.

Your job is to use Boolean filtering and generate box plots of the fare prices for each of the three passenger classes. The fare prices are contained in the 'fare' column and passenger class information is contained in the 'pclass' column.

When you're done, notice the portions of the box plots that differ and those that are similar.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you as titanic.

Time series in pandas

Indexing pandas time series


Creating and using a DatetimeIndex
The pandas Index is a powerful way to handle time series data, so it is valuable to know how to build one yourself. Pandas provides the pd.to_datetime() function for just this task. For example, if passed the list of strings ['2015-01-01 091234','2015-01-01 091234'] and a format specification variable, such as format='%Y-%m-%d %H%M%S, pandas will parse the string into the proper datetime elements and build the datetime objects.

In this exercise, a list of temperature data and a list of date strings has been pre-loaded for you as temperature_list and date_list respectively. Your job is to use the .to_datetime() method to build a DatetimeIndex out of the list of date strings, and to then use it along with the list of temperature data to build a pandas Series.

Instructions
100 XP
Prepare a format string, time_format, using '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' as the desired format.
Convert date_list into a datetime object by using the pd.to_datetime() function. Specify the format string you defined above and assign the result to my_datetimes.
Construct a pandas Series called time_series using pd.Series() with temperature_list and my_datetimes. Set the index of the Series to be my_datetimes.

# Prepare a format string: time_format
time_format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'

# Convert date_list into a datetime object: my_datetimes
my_datetimes = pd.to_datetime(date_list, format=time_format)  

# Construct a pandas Series using temperature_list and my_datetimes: time_series
time_series = pd.Series(temperature_list, index=my_datetimes)


______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Partial string indexing and slicing
Pandas time series support "partial string" indexing. What this means is that even when passed only a portion of the datetime, such as the date but not the time, pandas is remarkably good at doing what one would expect. Pandas datetime indexing also supports a wide variety of commonly used datetime string formats, even when mixed.

In this exercise, a time series that contains hourly weather data has been pre-loaded for you. This data was read using the parse_dates=True option in read_csv() with index_col="Dates" so that the Index is indeed a DatetimeIndex.

All data from the 'Temperature' column has been extracted into the variable ts0. Your job is to use a variety of natural date strings to extract one or more values from ts0.

After you are done, you will have three new variables - ts1, ts2, and ts3. You can slice these further to extract only the first and last entries of each. Try doing this after your submission for more practice.

Instructions
100 XP
Extract data from ts0 for a single hour - the hour from 9pm to 10pm on 2010-10-11. Assign it to ts1.
Extract data from ts0 for a single day - July 4th, 2010 - and assign it to ts2.
Extract data from ts0 for the second half of December 2010 - 12/15/2010 to 12/31/2010. Assign it to ts3.


# Extract the hour from 9pm to 10pm on '2010-10-11': ts1
ts1 = ts0.loc['2010-10-11 21:00:00':'2010-10-11 22:00:00']

# Extract '2010-07-04' from ts0: ts2
ts2 = ts0.loc['2010-07-04']

# Extract data from '2010-12-15' to '2010-12-31': ts3
ts3 = ts0.loc['2010-12-15':'2010-12-31']

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Reindexing the Index
Reindexing is useful in preparation for adding or otherwise combining two time series data sets. To reindex the data, we provide a new index and ask pandas to try and match the old data to the new index. If data is unavailable for one of the new index dates or times, you must tell pandas how to fill it in. Otherwise, pandas will fill with NaN by default.

In this exercise, two time series data sets containing daily data have been pre-loaded for you, each indexed by dates. The first, ts1, includes weekends, but the second, ts2, does not. The goal is to combine the two data sets in a sensible way. Your job is to reindex the second data set so that it has weekends as well, and then add it to the first. When you are done, it would be informative to inspect your results.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a new time series ts3 by reindexing ts2 with the index of ts1. To do this, call .reindex() on ts2 and pass in the index of ts1 (ts1.index).
Create another new time series, ts4, by calling the same .reindex() as above, but also specifiying a fill method, using the keyword argument method="ffill" to forward-fill values.
Add ts1 + ts2. Assign the result to sum12.
Add ts1 + ts3. Assign the result to sum13.
Add ts1 + ts4, Assign the result to sum14.

# Reindex without fill method: ts3
ts3 = ts2.reindex(ts1.index)

# Reindex with fill method, using forward fill: ts4
ts4 = ts2.reindex(ts1.index,method='ffill')

# Combine ts1 + ts2: sum12
sum12 = ts1 + ts2

# Combine ts1 + ts3: sum13
sum13 = ts1 + ts3

# Combine ts1 + ts4: sum14
sum14 = ts1 + ts4


________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Resampling and frequency
Pandas provides methods for resampling time series data. When downsampling or upsampling, the syntax is similar, but the methods called are different. Both use the concept of 'method chaining' - df.method1().method2().method3() - to direct the output from one method call to the input of the next, and so on, as a sequence of operations, one feeding into the next.

For example, if you have hourly data, and just need daily data, pandas will not guess how to throw out the 23 of 24 points. You must specify this in the method. One approach, for instance, could be to take the mean, as in df.resample('D').mean().

In this exercise, a data set containing hourly temperature data has been pre-loaded for you. Your job is to resample the data using a variety of aggregation methods to answer a few questions.

Instructions
100 XP
Downsample the 'Temperature' column of df to 6 hour data using .resample('6h') and .mean(). Assign the result to df1.
Downsample the 'Temperature' column of df to daily data using .resample('D') and then count the number of data points in each day with .count(). Assign the result df2.


# Downsample to 6 hour data and aggregate by mean: df1
df1 = df['Temperature'].resample('6h').mean()

# Downsample to daily data and count the number of data points: df2
df2 = df['Temperature'].resample('D').count()


_______________________________________________________________________________________________________---

Separating and resampling
With pandas, you can resample in different ways on different subsets of your data. For example, resampling different months of data with different aggregations. In this exercise, the data set containing hourly temperature data from the last exercise has been pre-loaded.

Your job is to resample the data using a variety of aggregation methods. The DataFrame is available in the workspace as df. You will be working with the 'Temperature' column.

Use partial string indexing to extract temperature data for August 2010 into august.
Use the temperature data for August and downsample to find the daily maximum temperatures. Store the result in august_highs.
Use partial string indexing to extract temperature data for February 2010 into february.
Use the temperature data for February and downsample to find the daily minimum temperatures. Store the result in february_lows.

# Extract temperature data for August: august
august = df.loc['2010-08','Temperature']

# Downsample to obtain only the daily highest temperatures in August: august_highs
august_highs = august.resample('D').max()

# Extract temperature data for February: february
february = df.loc['2010-02','Temperature']

# Downsample to obtain the daily lowest temperatures in February: february_lows
february_lows = february.resample('D').min()

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Rolling mean and frequency
In this exercise, some hourly weather data is pre-loaded for you. You will continue to practice resampling, this time using rolling means.

Rolling means (or moving averages) are generally used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in time series data and highlight long-term trends. You can read more about them here.

To use the .rolling() method, you must always use method chaining, first calling .rolling() and then chaining an aggregation method after it. For example, with a Series hourly_data, hourly_data.rolling(window=24).mean() would compute new values for each hourly point, based on a 24-hour window stretching out behind each point. The frequency of the output data is the same: it is still hourly. Such an operation is useful for smoothing time series data.

Your job is to resample the data using the combination of .rolling() and .mean(). You will work with the same DataFrame df from the previous exercise.

Instructions
100 XP
Use partial string indexing to extract temperature data from August 1 2010 to August 15 2010. Assign to unsmoothed.
Use .rolling() with a 24 hour window to smooth the mean temperature data. Assign the result to smoothed.
Use a dictionary to create a new DataFrame august with the time series smoothed and unsmoothed as columns.
Plot both the columns of august as line plots using the .plot() method.

# Extract data from 2010-Aug-01 to 2010-Aug-15: unsmoothed
unsmoothed = df['Temperature']['2010-08-01':'2010-08-15']

# Apply a rolling mean with a 24 hour window: smoothed
smoothed = unsmoothed.rolling(window=24).mean()

# Create a new DataFrame with columns smoothed and unsmoothed: august
august = pd.DataFrame({'smoothed':smoothed, 'unsmoothed':unsmoothed})

# Plot both smoothed and unsmoothed data using august.plot().
august.plot()
plt.show()


________________________________________________________________________________________________

Resample and roll with it
As of pandas version 0.18.0, the interface for applying rolling transformations to time series has become more consistent and flexible, and feels somewhat like a groupby (If you do not know what a groupby is, don't worry, you will learn about it in the next course!).

You can now flexibly chain together resampling and rolling operations. In this exercise, the same weather data from the previous exercises has been pre-loaded for you. Your job is to extract one month of data, resample to find the daily high temperatures, and then use a rolling and aggregation operation to smooth the data.

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Use partial string indexing to extract August 2010 temperature data, and assign to august.
Resample to daily frequency, saving the maximum daily temperatures, and assign the result to daily_highs.
As part of one long method chain, repeat the above resampling (or you can re-use daily_highs) and then combine it with .rolling() to apply a 7 day .mean() (with window=7 inside .rolling()) so as to smooth the daily highs. Assign the result to daily_highs_smoothed and print the result.


# Extract the August 2010 data: august
august = df['Temperature']['2010-08']

# Resample to daily data, aggregating by max: daily_highs
daily_highs = august.resample('D').max()

# Use a rolling 7-day window with method chaining to smooth the daily high temperatures in August
daily_highs_smoothed = daily_highs.rolling(window=7).mean()
print(daily_highs_smoothed)

Method chaining and filtering
We've seen that pandas supports method chaining. This technique can be very powerful when cleaning and filtering data.

In this exercise, a DataFrame containing flight departure data for a single airline and a single airport for the month of July 2015 has been pre-loaded. Your job is to use .str() filtering and method chaining to generate summary statistics on flight delays each day to Dallas.

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Use .str.strip() to strip extra whitespace from df.columns. Assign the result back to df.columns.
In the 'Destination Airport' column, extract all entries where Dallas ('DAL') is the destination airport. Use .str.contains('DAL') for this and store the result in dallas.
Resample dallas such that you get the total number of departures each day. Store the result in daily_departures.
Generate summary statistics for daily Dallas departures using .describe(). Store the result in stats.


# Strip extra whitespace from the column names: df.columns
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()

# Extract data for which the destination airport is Dallas: dallas
dallas = df['Destination Airport'].str.contains('DAL')

# Compute the total number of Dallas departures each day: daily_departures
daily_departures = dallas.resample('D').sum()

# Generate the summary statistics for daily Dallas departures: stats
stats = daily_departures.describe()

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Missing values and interpolation
One common application of interpolation in data analysis is to fill in missing data.

In this exercise, noisy measured data that has some dropped or otherwise missing values has been loaded. The goal is to compare two time series, and then look at summary statistics of the differences. The problem is that one of the data sets is missing data at some of the times. The pre-loaded data ts1 has value for all times, yet the data set ts2 does not: it is missing data for the weekends.

Your job is to first interpolate to fill in the data for all days. Then, compute the differences between the two data sets, now that they both have full support for all times. Finally, generate the summary statistics that describe the distribution of differences.

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Replace the index of ts2 with that of ts1, and then fill in the missing values of ts2 by using .interpolate(how='linear'). Save the result as ts2_interp.
Compute the difference between ts1 and ts2_interp. Take the absolute value of the difference with np.abs(), and assign the result to differences.
Generate and print summary statistics of the differences with .describe() and print().


# Reset the index of ts2 to ts1, and then use linear interpolation to fill in the NaNs: ts2_interp
ts2_interp = ts2.reindex(ts1.index).interpolate(how='linear')

# Compute the absolute difference of ts1 and ts2_interp: differences 
differences = np.abs(ts1 - ts2_interp)

# Generate and print summary statistics of the differences
print(differences.describe())

Time zones and conversion
Time zone handling with pandas typically assumes that you are handling the Index of the Series. In this exercise, you will learn how to handle timezones that are associated with datetimes in the column data, and not just the Index.

You will work with the flight departure dataset again, and this time you will select Los Angeles ('LAX') as the destination airport.

Here we will use a mask to ensure that we only compute on data we actually want. To learn more about Boolean masks, click here!

Instructions

Instructions
100 XP
Create a Boolean mask, mask, such that if the 'Destination Airport' column of df equals 'LAX', the result is True, and otherwise, it is False.
Use the mask to extract only the LAX rows. Assign the result to la.
Concatenate the two columns la['Date (MM/DD/YYYY)'] and la['Wheels-off Time'] with a ' ' space in between. Pass this to pd.to_datetime() to create a datetime array of all the times the LAX-bound flights left the ground.
Use Series.dt.tz_localize() to localize the time to 'US/Central'.
Use the .dt.tz_convert() method to convert datetimes from 'US/Central' to 'US/Pacific'.

# Build a Boolean mask to filter out all the 'LAX' departure flights: mask
mask = df['Destination Airport'] == 'LAX'

# Use the mask to subset the data: la
la = df[mask]

# Combine two columns of data to create a datetime series: times_tz_none 
times_tz_none = pd.to_datetime( la['Date (MM/DD/YYYY)'] + ' ' + la['Wheels-off Time'] )

# Localize the time to US/Central: times_tz_central
times_tz_central = times_tz_none.dt.tz_localize('US/Central')

# Convert the datetimes from US/Central to US/Pacific
times_tz_pacific = times_tz_central.dt.tz_convert('US/Pacific')

Plotting time series, datetime indexing
Pandas handles datetimes not only in your data, but also in your plotting.

In this exercise, some time series data has been pre-loaded. However, we have not parsed the date-like columns nor set the index, as we have done for you in the past!

The plot displayed is how pandas renders data with the default integer/positional index. Your job is to convert the 'Date' column from a collection of strings into a collection of datetime objects. Then, you will use this converted 'Date' column as your new index, and re-plot the data, noting the improved datetime awareness. After you are done, you can cycle between the two plots you generated by clicking on the 'Previous Plot' and 'Next Plot' buttons.

Before proceeding, look at the plot shown and observe how pandas handles data with the default integer index. Then, inspect the DataFrame df using the .head() method in the IPython Shell to get a feel for its structure.

Instructions
100 XP
Use pd.to_datetime() to convert the 'Date' column to a collection of datetime objects, and assign back to df.Date.
Set the index to this updated 'Date' column, using df.set_index() with the optional keyword argument inplace=True, so that you don't have to assign the result back to df.
Re-plot the DataFrame to see that the axis is now datetime aware. This code has been written for you.


# Plot the raw data before setting the datetime index
df.plot()
plt.show()

# Convert the 'Date' column into a collection of datetime objects: df.Date
df.Date = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Set the index to be the converted 'Date' column
df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Re-plot the DataFrame to see that the axis is now datetime aware!
df.plot()
plt.show()

Plotting date ranges, partial indexing
Now that you have set the DatetimeIndex in your DataFrame, you have a much more powerful and flexible set of tools to use when plotting your time series data. Of these, one of the most convenient is partial string indexing and slicing. In this exercise, we've pre-loaded a full year of Austin 2010 weather data, with the index set to be the datetime parsed 'Date' column as shown in the previous exercise.

Your job is to use partial string indexing of the dates, in a variety of datetime string formats, to plot all the summer data and just one week of data together. After you are done, you can cycle between the two plots by clicking on the 'Previous Plot' and 'Next Plot' buttons.

First, remind yourself how to extract one month of temperature data using 'May 2010' as a key into df.Temperature[], and call head() to inspect the result: df.Temperature['May 2010'].head().

Instructions
100 XP
Plot the summer temperatures using method chaining. The summer ranges from the months '2010-Jun' to '2010-Aug'.
Plot the temperatures for one week in June using the same method chaining, but this time indexing with '2010-06-10':'2010-06-17' before you follow up with .plot().

# Plot the summer data
df.Temperature['2010-Jun':'2010-Aug'].plot()
plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Plot the one week data
df.Temperature['2010-06-10':'2010-06-17'].plot()
plt.show()
plt.clf()

Reading and cleaning the data

eading in a data file
Now that you have identified the method to use to read the data, let's try to read one file. The problem with real data such as this is that the files are almost never formatted in a convenient way. In this exercise, there are several problems to overcome in reading the file. First, there is no header, and thus the columns don't have labels. There is also no obvious index column, since none of the data columns contain a full date or time.

Your job is to read the file into a DataFrame using the default arguments. After inspecting it, you will re-read the file specifying that there are no headers supplied.

The CSV file has been provided for you as the variable data_file.

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Import pandas as pd.
Read the file data_file into a DataFrame called df.
Print the output of df.head(). This has been done for you. Notice the formatting problems in df.
Re-read the data using specifying the keyword argument header=None and assign it to df_headers.
Print the output of df_headers.head(). This has already been done for you. Hit 'Submit Answer' and see how this resolves the formatting issues.


# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read in the data file: df
df = pd.read_csv(data_file)

# Print the output of df.head()
print(df.head())

# Read in the data file with header=None: df_headers
df_headers = pd.read_csv(data_file, header=None)

# Print the output of df_headers.head()
print(df_headers.head())


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-
Re-assigning column names
After the initial step of reading in the data, the next step is to clean and tidy it so that it is easier to work with.

In this exercise, you will begin this cleaning process by re-assigning column names and dropping unnecessary columns.

pandas has been imported in the workspace as pd, and the file NOAA_QCLCD_2011_hourly_13904.txt has been parsed and loaded into a DataFrame df. The comma separated string of column names, column_labels, and list of columns to drop, list_to_drop, have also been loaded for you.

Instructions
100 XP
Convert the comma separated string column_labels to a list of strings using .split(','). Assign the result to column_labels_list.
Reassign df.columns using the list of strings column_labels_list.
Call df.drop() with list_to_drop and axis='columns'. Assign the result to df_dropped.
Print df_dropped.head() to examine the result. This has already been done for you.


# Split on the comma to create a list: column_labels_list
column_labels_list = column_labels.split(',')

# Assign the new column labels to the DataFrame: df.columns
df.columns = column_labels_list

# Remove the appropriate columns: df_dropped
df_dropped = df.drop(list_to_drop, axis='columns')

# Print the output of df_dropped.head()
print(df_dropped.head())

leaning and tidying datetime data
In order to use the full power of pandas time series, you must construct a DatetimeIndex. To do so, it is necessary to clean and transform the date and time columns.

The DataFrame df_dropped you created in the last exercise is provided for you and pandas has been imported as pd.

Your job is to clean up the date and Time columns and combine them into a datetime collection to be used as the Index.

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Convert the 'date' column to a string with .astype(str) and assign to df_dropped['date'].
Add leading zeros to the 'Time' column. This has been done for you.
Concatenate the new 'date' and 'Time' columns together. Assign to date_string.
Convert the date_string Series to datetime values with pd.to_datetime(). Specify the format parameter.
Set the index of the df_dropped DataFrame to be date_times. Assign the result to df_clean.


# Convert the date column to string: df_dropped['date']
df_dropped['date'] = df_dropped['date'].astype(str)

# Pad leading zeros to the Time column: df_dropped['Time']
df_dropped['Time'] = df_dropped['Time'].apply(lambda x:'{:0>4}'.format(x))

# Concatenate the new date and Time columns: date_string
date_string = df_dropped['date'] + df_dropped['Time'] 

# Convert the date_string Series to datetime: date_times
date_times = pd.to_datetime(date_string, format='%Y%m%d%H%M')

# Set the index to be the new date_times container: df_clean
df_clean = df_dropped.set_index(date_times)

# Print the output of df_clean.head()
print(df_clean.head())

Cleaning the numeric columns
The numeric columns contain missing values labeled as 'M'. In this exercise, your job is to transform these columns such that they contain only numeric values and interpret missing data as NaN.

The pandas function pd.to_numeric() is ideal for this purpose: It converts a Series of values to floating-point values. Furthermore, by specifying the keyword argument errors='coerce', you can force strings like 'M' to be interpreted as NaN.

A DataFrame df_clean is provided for you at the start of the exercise, and as usual, pandas has been imported as pd.

df_clean['dry_bulb_faren'] = pd.to_numeric(df_clean['dry_bulb_faren'], errors='coerce')

# Print the transformed dry_bulb_faren temperature between 8 AM and 9 AM on June 20, 2011
print(df_clean.loc['2011-6-20 8:00:00':'2011-6-20 9:00:00', 'dry_bulb_faren'])

# Convert the wind_speed and dew_point_faren columns to numeric values
df_clean['wind_speed'] = pd.to_numeric(df_clean['wind_speed'], errors='coerce')
df_clean['dew_point_faren'] = pd.to_numeric(df_clean['dew_point_faren'], errors='coerce')

Signal min, max, median
Now that you have the data read and cleaned, you can begin with statistical EDA. First, you will analyze the 2011 Austin weather data.

Your job in this exercise is to analyze the 'dry_bulb_faren' column and print the median temperatures for specific time ranges. You can do this using partial datetime string selection.

The cleaned dataframe is provided in the workspace as df_clean.

Instructions
100 XP
Select the 'dry_bulb_faren' column and print the output of .median().
Use .loc[] to select the range '2011-Apr':'2011-Jun' from dry_bulb_faren' and print the output of .median().
Use .loc[] to select the month '2011-Jan' from 'dry_bulb_faren' and print the output of .median().

# Print the dry_bulb_faren temperature between 8 AM and 9 AM on June 20, 2011
print(df_clean.loc['2011-6-20 8:00:00':'2011-6-20 9:00:00', 'dry_bulb_faren'])

# Convert the dry_bulb_faren column to numeric values: df_clean['dry_bulb_faren']
df_clean['dry_bulb_faren'] = pd.to_numeric(df_clean['dry_bulb_faren'], errors='coerce')

# Print the transformed dry_bulb_faren temperature between 8 AM and 9 AM on June 20, 2011

Signal variance
You're now ready to compare the 2011 weather data with the 30-year normals reported in 2010. You can ask questions such as, on average, how much hotter was every day in 2011 than expected from the 30-year average?

The DataFrames df_clean and df_climate from previous exercises are available in the workspace.

Your job is to first resample df_clean and df_climate by day and aggregate the mean temperatures. You will then extract the temperature related columns from each - 'dry_bulb_faren' in df_clean, and 'Temperature' in df_climate - as NumPy arrays and compute the difference.

Notice that the indexes of df_clean and df_climate are not aligned - df_clean has dates in 2011, while df_climate has dates in 2010. This is why you extract the temperature columns as NumPy arrays. An alternative approach is to use the pandas .reset_index() method to make sure the Series align properly. You will practice this approach as well.

Instructions
100 XP
Downsample df_clean with daily frequency and aggregate by the mean. Store the result as daily_mean_2011.
Extract the 'dry_bulb_faren' column from daily_mean_2011 as a NumPy array using .values. Store the result as daily_temp_2011. Note: .values is an attribute, not a method, so you don't have to use ().
Downsample df_climate with daily frequency and aggregate by the mean. Store the result as daily_climate.
Extract the 'Temperature' column from daily_climate using the .reset_index() method. To do this, first reset the index of daily_climate, and then use bracket slicing to access 'Temperature'. Store the result as daily_temp_climate.


# Downsample df_clean by day and aggregate by mean: daily_mean_2011
daily_mean_2011 = df_clean.resample('D').mean()

# Extract the dry_bulb_faren column from daily_mean_2011 using .values: daily_temp_2011
daily_temp_2011 = daily_mean_2011['dry_bulb_faren'].values

# Downsample df_climate by day and aggregate by mean: daily_climate
daily_climate = df_climate.resample('D').mean()

# Extract the Temperature column from daily_climate using .reset_index(): daily_temp_climate
daily_temp_climate = daily_climate.reset_index()['Temperature']

# Compute the difference between the two arrays and print the mean difference
difference = daily_temp_2011 - daily_temp_climate
print(difference.mean())

Sunny or cloudy
On average, how much hotter is it when the sun is shining? In this exercise, you will compare temperatures on sunny days against temperatures on overcast days.

Your job is to use Boolean selection to filter out sunny and overcast days, and then compute the difference of the mean daily maximum temperatures between each type of day.

The DataFrame df_clean from previous exercises has been provided for you. The column 'sky_condition' provides information about whether the day was sunny ('CLR') or overcast ('OVC').

Use .loc[] to select sunny days and assign to sunny. If 'sky_condition' equals 'CLR', then the day is sunny.
Use .loc[] to select overcast days and assign to overcast. If 'sky_condition' contains 'OVC', then the day is overcast.
Resample sunny and overcast and aggregate by the maximum (.max()) daily ('D') temperature. Assign to sunny_daily_max and overcast_daily_max.
Print the difference between the mean of sunny_daily_max and overcast_daily_max. This has already been done for you, so click 'Submit Answer' to view the result!


# Select days that are sunny: sunny
sunny = df_clean.loc[df_clean['sky_condition']=='CLR']

# Select days that are overcast: overcast
overcast = df_clean.loc[df_clean['sky_condition'].str.contains('OVC')]

# Resample sunny and overcast, aggregating by maximum daily temperature
sunny_daily_max = sunny.resample('D').max()
overcast_daily_max = overcast.resample('D').max()

# Print the difference between the mean of sunny_daily_max and overcast_daily_max
print(sunny_daily_max.mean() - overcast_daily_max.mean())

Weekly average temperature and visibility
Is there a correlation between temperature and visibility? Let's find out.

In this exercise, your job is to plot the weekly average temperature and visibility as subplots. To do this, you need to first select the appropriate columns and then resample by week, aggregating the mean.

In addition to creating the subplots, you will compute the Pearson correlation coefficient using .corr(). The Pearson correlation coefficient, known also as Pearson's r, ranges from -1 (indicating total negative linear correlation) to 1 (indicating total positive linear correlation). A value close to 1 here would indicate that there is a strong correlation between temperature and visibility.

The DataFrame df_clean has been pre-loaded for you.

Instructions
100 XP
Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Select the 'visibility' and 'dry_bulb_faren' columns and resample them by week, aggregating the mean. Assign the result to weekly_mean.
Print the output of weekly_mean.corr().
Plot the weekly_mean dataframe with .plot(), specifying subplots=True.

# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Select the visibility and dry_bulb_faren columns and resample them: weekly_mean
weekly_mean = df_clean[['visibility','dry_bulb_faren']].resample('W').mean()

# Print the output of weekly_mean.corr()
print(weekly_mean.corr())

# Plot weekly_mean with subplots=True
weekly_mean.plot(subplots=True)

Daily hours of clear sky
In a previous exercise, you analyzed the 'sky_condition' column to explore the difference in temperature on sunny days compared to overcast days. Recall that a 'sky_condition' of 'CLR' represents a sunny day. In this exercise, you will explore sunny days in greater detail. Specifically, you will use a box plot to visualize the fraction of days that are sunny.

The 'sky_condition' column is recorded hourly. Your job is to resample this column appropriately such that you can extract the number of sunny hours in a day and the number of total hours. Then, you can divide the number of sunny hours by the number of total hours, and generate a box plot of the resulting fraction.

As before, df_clean is available for you in the workspace.

Make a box plot of sunny_fraction.


# Create a Boolean Series for sunny days: sunny
sunny = df_clean['sky_condition'] == 'CLR'

# Resample the Boolean Series by day and compute the sum: sunny_hours
sunny_hours = sunny.resample('D').sum()

# Resample the Boolean Series by day and compute the count: total_hours

Heat or humidity
Dew point is a measure of relative humidity based on pressure and temperature. A dew point above 65 is considered uncomfortable while a temperature above 90 is also considered uncomfortable.

In this exercise, you will explore the maximum temperature and dew point of each month. The columns of interest are 'dew_point_faren' and 'dry_bulb_faren'. After resampling them appropriately to get the maximum temperature and dew point in each month, generate a histogram of these values as subplots. Uncomfortably, you will notice that the maximum dew point is above 65 every month!

Probability of high temperatures
We already know that 2011 was hotter than the climate normals for the previous thirty years. In this final exercise, you will compare the maximum temperature in August 2011 against that of the August 2010 climate normals. More specifically, you will use a CDF plot to determine the probability of the 2011 daily maximum temperature in August being above the 2010 climate normal value. To do this, you will leverage the data manipulation, filtering, resampling, and visualization skills you have acquired throughout this course.

The two DataFrames df_clean and df_climate are available in the workspace. Your job is to select the maximum temperature in August in df_climate, and then maximum daily temperatures in August 2011. You will then filter out the days in August 2011 that were above the August 2010 maximum, and use this to construct a CDF plot.

Once you've generated the CDF, notice how it shows that there was a 50% probability of the 2011 daily maximum temperature in August being 5 degrees above the 2010 climate normal value!

From df_climate, extract the maximum temperature observed in August 2010. The relevant column here is 'Temperature'. You can select the rows corresponding to August 2010 in multiple ways. For example, df_climate.loc['2011-Feb'] selects all rows corresponding to February 2011, while df_climate.loc['2009-09', 'Pressure'] selects the rows corresponding to September 2009 from the 'Pressure' column.
From df_clean, select the August 2011 temperature data from the 'dry_bulb_faren'. Resample this data by day and aggregate the maximum value. Store the result in august_2011.
Filter rows of august_2011 to keep days where the value exceeded august_max. Store the result in august_2011_high.
Construct a CDF of august_2011_high using 25 bins. Remember to specify the kind, normed, and cumulative parameters in addition to bins.


# Extract the maximum temperature in August 2010 from df_climate: august_max
august_max = df_climate.loc['2010-Aug','Temperature'].max()
print(august_max)

# Resample August 2011 temps in df_clean by day & aggregate the max value: august_2011
august_2011 = df_clean.loc['2011-Aug','dry_bulb_faren'].resample('D').max()


# Filter for days in august_2011 where the value exceeds august_max: august_2011_high

august_2011_high = august_2011[august_2011 > august_max]

# Construct a CDF of august_2011_high
august_2011_high.plot(kind='hist',bins=25, normed=True, cumulative=True)

# Display the plot
