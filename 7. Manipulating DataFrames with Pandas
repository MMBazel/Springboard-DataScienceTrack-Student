Course Description
In this course, you'll learn how to leverage pandas' extremely powerful data manipulation engine to get the most out of your data. It is important to be able to extract, filter, and transform data from DataFrames in order to drill into the data that really matters. The pandas library has many techniques that make this process efficient and intuitive. You will learn how to tidy, rearrange, and restructure your data by pivoting or melting and stacking or unstacking DataFrames. These are all fundamental next steps on the road to becoming a well-rounded Data Scientist, and you will have the chance to apply all the concepts you learn to real-world datasets.

===============================================================================================================
1
Extracting and transforming data


In this chapter, you will learn all about how to index, slice, filter, and transform DataFrames, using a variety of datasets, ranging from 2012 US election data for the state of Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh weather data.

_______________________________________________________________________
Positional and labeled indexing
Given a pair of label-based indices, sometimes it's necessary to find the corresponding positions. In this exercise, you will use the Pennsylvania election results again. The DataFrame is provided for you as election.

Find x and y such that election.iloc[x, y] == election.loc['Bedford', 'winner']. That is, what is the row position of 'Bedford', and the column position of 'winner'? Remember that the first position in Python is 0, not 1!

To answer this question, first explore the DataFrame using election.head() in the IPython Shell and inspect it with your eyes.

Explore the DataFrame in the IPython Shell using election.head().
Assign the row position of election.loc['Bedford'] to x.
Assign the column position of election['winner'] to y.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to print the boolean equivalence of the .loc and .iloc selections.

# Assign the row position of election.loc['Bedford']: x
x = 4

# Assign the column position of election['winner']: y
y = 4

# Print the boolean equivalence
print(election.iloc[x, y] == election.loc['Bedford', 'winner'])


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Indexing and column rearrangement
There are circumstances in which it's useful to modify the order of your DataFrame columns. We do that now by extracting just two columns from the Pennsylvania election results DataFrame.

Your job is to read the CSV file and set the index to 'county'. You'll then assign a new DataFrame by selecting the list of columns ['winner', 'total', 'voters']. The CSV file is provided to you in the variable filename.

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Import pandas as pd.
Read in filename using pd.read_csv() and set the index to 'county' by specifying the index_col parameter.
Create a separate DataFrame results with the columns ['winner', 'total', 'voters'].
Print the output using results.head(). This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the new DataFrame!

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read in filename and set the index: election
election = pd.read_csv(filename, index_col='county')

# Create a separate dataframe with the columns ['winner', 'total', 'voters']: results
results = election[['winner', 'total', 'voters']]

# Print the output of results.head()
print(results.head())

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-----

Slicing rows
The Pennsylvania US election results data set that you have been using so far is ordered by county name. This means that county names can be sliced alphabetically. In this exercise, you're going to perform slicing on the county names of the election DataFrame from the previous exercises, which has been pre-loaded for you.

Instructions
100 XP
Slice the row labels 'Perry' to 'Potter' and assign the output to p_counties.
Print the p_counties DataFrame. This has been done for you.
Slice the row labels 'Potter' to 'Perry' in reverse order. To do this for hypothetical row labels 'a' and 'b', you could use a stepsize of -1 like so: df.loc['b':'a':-1].
Print the p_counties_rev DataFrame. This has also been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result of your slicing!


# Slice the row labels 'Perry' to 'Potter': p_counties
p_counties = election.loc['Perry':'Potter']

# Print the p_counties DataFrame
print(p_counties)

# Slice the row labels 'Potter' to 'Perry' in reverse order: p_counties_rev
p_counties_rev = election.loc['Potter':'Perr':-1]

# Print the p_counties_rev DataFrame
print(p_counties_rev)


________________________________________________________________


licing columns
Similar to row slicing, columns can be sliced by value. In this exercise, your job is to slice column names from the Pennsylvania election results DataFrame using .loc[].

It has been pre-loaded for you as election, with the index set to 'county'.

Instructions
100 XP
Slice the columns from the starting column to 'Obama' and assign the result to left_columns
Slice the columns from 'Obama' to 'winner' and assign the result to middle_columns
Slice the columns from 'Romney' to the end and assign the result to right_columns
The code to print the first 5 rows of left_columns, middle_columns, and right_columns has been written, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results!

# Slice the columns from the starting column to 'Obama': left_columns
left_columns = election.loc[:,:'Obama']

# Print the output of left_columns.head()
print(left_columns.head())

# Slice the columns from 'Obama' to 'winner': middle_columns
middle_columns = election.loc[:,'Obama':'winner']

# Print the output of middle_columns.head()
print(middle_columns.head())

# Slice the columns from 'Romney' to the end: 'right_columns'
right_columns = election.loc[:,'Romney':]

# Print the output of right_columns.head()
print(right_columns.head())

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Subselecting DataFrames with lists
You can use lists to select specific row and column labels with the .loc[] accessor. In this exercise, your job is to select the counties ['Philadelphia', 'Centre', 'Fulton'] and the columns ['winner','Obama','Romney'] from the election DataFrame, which has been pre-loaded for you with the index set to 'county'.

Instructions
100 XP
Create the list of row labels ['Philadelphia', 'Centre', 'Fulton'] and assign it to rows.
Create the list of column labels ['winner', 'Obama', 'Romney'] and assign it to cols.
Create a new DataFrame by selecting with rows and cols in .loc[] and assign it to three_counties.
Print the three_counties DataFrame. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer` to see your new DataFrame.


# Create the list of row labels: rows
rows = ['Philadelphia', 'Centre', 'Fulton']

# Create the list of column labels: cols
cols = ['winner', 'Obama', 'Romney']

# Create the new DataFrame: three_counties
three_counties = election.loc[rows, cols]

# Print the three_counties DataFrame
print(three_counties)


_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Thresholding data
In this exercise, we have provided the Pennsylvania election results and included a column called 'turnout' that contains the percentage of voter turnout per county. Your job is to prepare a boolean array to select all of the rows and columns where voter turnout exceeded 70%.

As before, the DataFrame is available to you as election with the index set to 'county'.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a boolean array of the condition where the 'turnout' column is greater than 70 and assign it to high_turnout.
Filter the election DataFrame with the high_turnout array and assign it to high_turnout_df.
Print the filtered DataFrame. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see it!


# Create the boolean array: high_turnout
high_turnout = election.turnout>70

# Filter the election DataFrame with the high_turnout array: high_turnout_df
high_turnout_df = election[high_turnout]

# Print the high_turnout_results DataFrame
print(high_turnout_df)


____________________________________________________________________________________________

Filtering columns using other columns
The election results DataFrame has a column labeled 'margin' which expresses the number of extra votes the winner received over the losing candidate. This number is given as a percentage of the total votes cast. It is reasonable to assume that in counties where this margin was less than 1%, the results would be too-close-to-call.

Your job is to use boolean selection to filter the rows where the margin was less than 1. You'll then convert these rows of the 'winner' column to np.nan to indicate that these results are too close to declare a winner.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you as election.

Instructions
100 XP
Import numpy as np.
Create a boolean array for the condition where the 'margin' column is less than 1 and assign it to too_close.
Convert the entries in the 'winner' column where the result was too close to call to np.nan.
Print the output of election.info(). This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results.

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create the boolean array: too_close
too_close = election.margin < 1

# Assign np.nan to the 'winner' column where the results were too close to call
election.winner[too_close] = np.nan

# Print the output of election.info()
print(election.info())

__________________________________________________________________________________________


Filtering using NaNs
In certain scenarios, it may be necessary to remove rows and columns with missing data from a DataFrame. The .dropna() method is used to perform this action. You'll now practice using this method on a dataset obtained from Vanderbilt University, which consists of data from passengers on the Titanic.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you as titanic. Explore it in the IPython Shell and you will note that there are many NaNs. You will focus specifically on the 'age' and 'cabin' columns in this exercise. Your job is to use .dropna() to remove rows where any of these two columns contains missing data and rows where all of these two columns contain missing data.

You'll also use the .shape attribute, which returns the number of rows and columns in a tuple from a DataFrame, or the number of rows from a Series, to see the effect of dropping missing values from a DataFrame.

Finally, you'll use the thresh= keyword argument to drop columns from the full dataset that have less than 1000 non-missing values.

Instructions
100 XP
Select the 'age' and 'cabin' columns of titanic and create a new DataFrame df.
Print the shape of df. This has been done for you.
Drop rows in df with how='any' and print the shape.
Drop rows in df with how='all' and print the shape.
Drop columns from the titanic DataFrame that have less than 1000 non-missing values by specifying the thresh and axis keyword arguments. Print the output of .info() from this.

# Select the 'age' and 'cabin' columns: df
df = titanic.loc[:,['age','cabin']]

# Print the shape of df
print(df.shape)

# Drop rows in df with how='any' and print the shape
print(df.dropna(how='any').shape)

# Drop rows in df with how='all' and print the shape
print(df.dropna(how='all').shape)

# Drop columns in titanic with less than 1000 non-missing values
print(titanic.dropna(thresh=1000, axis='columns').info())



___________________________________________________________________________________

Using apply() to transform a column
The .apply() method can be used on a pandas DataFrame to apply an arbitrary Python function to every element. In this exercise you'll take daily weather data in Pittsburgh in 2013 obtained from Weather Underground.

A function to convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius has been written for you. Your job is to use the .apply() method to perform this conversion on the 'Mean TemperatureF' and 'Mean Dew PointF' columns of the weather DataFrame.

Instructions
100 XP
Apply the to_celsius function over the ['Mean TemperatureF','Mean Dew PointF'] columns of the weather DataFrame.
Reassign the columns of df_celsius to ['Mean TemperatureC','Mean Dew PointC'].
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the new DataFrame with the converted units.


# Write a function to convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius: to_celsius
def to_celsius(F):
    return 5/9*(F - 32)

# Apply the function over 'Mean TemperatureF' and 'Mean Dew PointF': df_celsius
df_celsius = weather[['Mean TemperatureF','Mean Dew PointF']].apply(to_celsius)

# Reassign the columns df_celsius
df_celsius.columns = ['Mean TemperatureC', 'Mean Dew PointC']

# Print the output of df_celsius.head()
print(df_celsius.head())


_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Using .map() with a dictionary
The .map() method is used to transform values according to a Python dictionary look-up. In this exercise you'll practice this method while returning to working with the election DataFrame, which has been pre-loaded for you.

Your job is to use a dictionary to map the values 'Obama' and 'Romney' in the 'winner' column to the values 'blue' and 'red', and assign the output to the new column 'color'.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a dictionary with the key:value pairs 'Obama':'blue' and 'Romney':'red'.
Use the .map() method on the 'winner' column using the red_vs_blue dictionary you created.
Print the output of election.head(). This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the new column!

Original data set:

election.head()

# Create the dictionary: red_vs_blue
red_vs_blue = {'Obama':'blue','Romney':'red'}

# Use the dictionary to map the 'winner' column to the new column: election['color']
election['color'] = election.winner.map(red_vs_blue)

# Print the output of election.head()
print(election.head())



       state   total      Obama     Romney  winner  voters color
    county

    Bedford      PA   21444  22.057452  76.986570  Romney   32189   red




___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Using vectorized functions
When performance is paramount, you should avoid using .apply() and .map() because those constructs perform Python for-loops over the data stored in a pandas Series or DataFrame. By using vectorized functions instead, you can loop over the data at the same speed as compiled code (C, Fortran, etc.)! NumPy, SciPy and pandas come with a variety of vectorized functions (called Universal Functions or UFuncs in NumPy).

You can even write your own vectorized functions, but for now we will focus on the ones distributed by NumPy and pandas.

In this exercise you're going to import the zscore function from scipy.stats and use it to compute the deviation in voter turnout in Pennsylvania from the mean in fractions of the standard deviation. In statistics, the z-score is the number of standard deviations by which an observation is above the mean - so if it is negative, it means the observation is below the mean.

Instead of using .apply() as you did in the earlier exercises, the zscore UFunc will take a pandas Series as input and return a NumPy array. You will then assign the values of the NumPy array to a new column in the DataFrame. You will be working with the election DataFrame - it has been pre-loaded for you.

Instructions
100 XP
Import zscore from scipy.stats.
Call zscore with election['turnout'] as input .
Print the output of type(turnout_zscore). This has been done for you.
Assign turnout_zscore to a new column in election as 'turnout_zscore'.
Print the output of election.head(). This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to view the result.

Advanced indexing

Having learned the fundamentals of working with DataFrames, you will now move on to more advanced indexing techniques. You will learn about MultiIndexes, or hierarchical indexes, and learn how to interact with and extract data from them.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Changing index of a DataFrame
As you saw in the previous exercise, indexes are immutable objects. This means that if you want to change or modify the index in a DataFrame, then you need to change the whole index. You will do this now, using a list comprehension to create the new index.

A list comprehension is a succinct way to generate a list in one line. For example, the following list comprehension generates a list that contains the cubes of all numbers from 0 to 9: cubes = [i**3 for i in range(10)]. This is equivalent to the following code:

cubes = []
for i in range(10):
    cubes.append(i**3)
Before getting started, print the sales DataFrame in the IPython Shell and verify that the index is given by month abbreviations containing lowercase characters.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a list new_idx with the same elements as in sales.index, but with all characters capitalized.
Assign new_idx to sales.index.
Print the sales dataframe. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' and to see how the index changed.


In [1]: sales.head()
Out[1]: 
       eggs  salt  spam
month                  
Jan      47  12.0    17
Feb     110  50.0    31
Mar     221  89.0    72
Apr      77  87.0    20
May     132   NaN    52


# Create the list of new indexes: new_idx
new_idx = [month.upper() for month in sales.index]

# Assign new_idx to sales.index
sales.index = new_idx

# Print the sales DataFrame
print(sales)


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Changing index name labels
Notice that in the previous exercise, the index was not labeled with a name. In this exercise, you will set its name to 'MONTHS'.

Similarly, if all the columns are related in some way, you can provide a label for the set of columns.

To get started, print the sales DataFrame in the IPython Shell and verify that the index has no name, only its data (the month names).

Instructions
100 XP
Assign the string 'MONTHS' to sales.index.name to create a name for the index.
Print the sales dataframe to see the index name you just created.
Now assign the string 'PRODUCTS' to sales.columns.name to give a name to the set of columns.
Print the sales dataframe again to see the columns name you just created.


# Assign the string 'MONTHS' to sales.index.name
sales.index.name = 'MONTHS'

# Print the sales DataFrame
print(sales)

# Assign the string 'PRODUCTS' to sales.columns.name 
sales.columns.name = 'PRODUCTS'

# Print the sales dataframe again
print(sales)


___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Building an index, then a DataFrame
You can also build the DataFrame and index independently, and then put them together. If you take this route, be careful, as any mistakes in generating the DataFrame or the index can cause the data and the index to be aligned incorrectly.

In this exercise, the sales DataFrame has been provided for you without the month index. Your job is to build this index separately and then assign it to the sales DataFrame. Before getting started, print the sales DataFrame in the IPython Shell and note that it's missing the month information.

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Generate a list months with the data ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun']. This has been done for you.
Assign months to sales.index.
Print the modified sales dataframe and verify that you now have month information in the index.


# Generate the list of months: months
months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun']

# Assign months to sales.index
sales.index = months

# Print the modified sales DataFrame
print(sales)


__________________________________________________________________________________

Extracting data with a MultiIndex
In the video, Dhavide explained the concept of a hierarchical index, or a MultiIndex. You will now practice working with these types of indexes.

The sales DataFrame you have been working with has been extended to now include State information as well. In the IPython Shell, print the new sales DataFrame to inspect the data. Take note of the MultiIndex!

Extracting elements from the outermost level of a MultiIndex is just like in the case of a single-level Index. You can use the .loc[] accessor as Dhavide demonstrated in the video.

Instructions
100 XP
Print sales.loc[['CA', 'TX']]. Note how New York is excluded.
Print sales['CA':'TX']. Note how New York is included.

In [1]: sales.head()
Out[1]: 
             eggs  salt  spam
state month                  
CA    1        47  12.0    17
      2       110  50.0    31
NY    1       221  89.0    72
      2        77  87.0    20
TX    1       132   NaN    52



# Print sales.loc[['CA', 'TX']]
print(sales.loc[['CA', 'TX']])

# Print sales['CA':'TX']
print(sales['CA':'TX'])


# Print sales.loc[['CA', 'TX']]
print(sales.loc[['CA', 'TX']])

# Print sales['CA':'TX']
print(sales['CA':'TX'])


___________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Setting & sorting a MultiIndex
In the previous exercise, the MultiIndex was created and sorted for you. Now, you're going to do this yourself! With a MultiIndex, you should always ensure the index is sorted. You can skip this only if you know the data is already sorted on the index fields.

To get started, print the pre-loaded sales DataFrame in the IPython Shell to verify that there is no MultiIndex.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a MultiIndex by setting the index to be the columns ['state', 'month'].
Sort the MultiIndex using the .sort_index() method.
Print the sales DataFrame. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to verify that indeed you have an index with the fields state and month!



# Set the index to be the columns ['state', 'month']: sales
sales = sales.set_index(['state', 'month'])

# Sort the MultiIndex: sales
sales = sales.sort_index()

# Print the sales DataFrame
print(sales)



<script.py> output:
                 eggs  salt  spam
    state month                  
    CA    1        47  12.0    17
          2       110  50.0    31
    NY    1       221  89.0    72
          2        77  87.0    20
    TX    1       132   NaN    52
          2       205  60.0    55
          
          
 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 
Using .loc[] with nonunique indexes
As Dhavide mentioned in the video, it is always preferable to have a meaningful index that uniquely identifies each row. Even though pandas does not require unique index values in DataFrames, it works better if the index values are indeed unique. To see an example of this, you will index your sales data by 'state' in this exercise.

As always, begin by printing the sales DataFrame in the IPython Shell and inspecting it.

Instructions
100 XP
Set the index of sales to be the column 'state'.
Print the sales DataFrame to verify that indeed you have an index with state values.
Access the data from 'NY' and print it to verify that you obtain two rows.


# Set the index to the column 'state': sales
sales = sales.set_index('state')

# Print the sales DataFrame
print(sales)

# Access the data from 'NY'
print(sales.loc['NY'])

# Set the index to the column 'state': sales
sales = sales.set_index('state')

# Print the sales DataFrame
print(sales)

# Access the data from 'NY'
print(sales.loc['NY'])


Here, because you have nonunique indexes, two rows are returned.
<script.py> output:

Indexing multiple levels of a MultiIndex
Looking up indexed data is fast and efficient. And you have already seen that lookups based on the outermost level of a MultiIndex work just like lookups on DataFrames that have a single-level Index.

Looking up data based on inner levels of a MultiIndex can be a bit trickier. In this exercise, you will use your sales DataFrame to do some increasingly complex lookups.

The trickiest of all these lookups are when you want to access some inner levels of the index. In this case, you need to use slice(None) in the slicing parameter for the outermost dimension(s) instead of the usual :, or use pd.IndexSlice. You can refer to the pandas documentation for more details. For example, in the video, Dhavide used the following code to extract rows from all Symbols for the dates Oct. 3rd through 4th inclusive:

stocks.loc[(slice(None), slice('2016-10-03', '2016-10-04')), :]
Pay particular attention to the tuple (slice(None), slice('2016-10-03', '2016-10-04')).

Instructions
100 XP
Look up data for the New York column ('NY') in month 1.
Look up data for the California and Texas columns ('CA', 'TX') in month 2.
Look up data for all states in month 2. Use (slice(None), 2) to extract all rows in month 2.

Hint:
Use the .loc[] accessor on sales with ('NY', 1) to look up data for 'NY' in month 1.
Use the .loc[] accessor on sales with (['CA', 'TX'], 2), : to look up data for 'CA' and 'TX' in month 2.
Use the .loc[] accessor on sales with (slice(None), 2), : to look up data for all states in month 2.


# Look up data for NY in month 1: NY_month1
NY_month1 = sales.loc[('NY', 1), :]

# Look up data for CA and TX in month 2: CA_TX_month2
CA_TX_month2 = sales.loc[(['CA', 'TX'], 2), :]

# Look up data for all states in month 2: all_month2
all_month2 = sales.loc[(slice(None), 2), :]

Rearranging and reshaping data

Here, you will learn how to reshape your DataFrames using techniques such as pivoting, melting, stacking, and unstacking. These are powerful techniques that allow you to tidy and rearrange your data into the format that allows you to most easily analyze it for insights.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Pivoting a single variable
Suppose you started a blog for a band, and you would like to log how many visitors you have had, and how many signed-up for your newsletter. To help design the tours later, you track where the visitors are. A DataFrame called users consisting of this information has been pre-loaded for you.

Inspect users in the IPython Shell and make a note of which variable you want to use to index the rows ('weekday'), which variable you want to use to index the columns ('city'), and which variable will populate the values in the cells ('visitors'). Try to visualize what the result should be.

For example, in the video, Dhavide used 'treatment' to index the rows, 'gender' to index the columns, and 'response' to populate the cells. Prior to pivoting, the DataFrame looked like this:

   id treatment gender  response
0   1         A      F         5
1   2         A      M         3
2   3         B      F         8
3   4         B      M         9
After pivoting:

gender     F  M
treatment      
A          5  3
B          8  9
In this exercise, your job is to pivot users so that the focus is on 'visitors', with the columns indexed by 'city' and the rows indexed by 'weekday'.

Pivoting all variables
If you do not select any particular variables, all of them will be pivoted. In this case - with the users DataFrame - both 'visitors' and 'signups' will be pivoted, creating hierarchical column labels.

You will explore this for yourself now in this exercise.

Stacking & unstacking I
You are now going to practice stacking and unstacking DataFrames. The users DataFrame you have been working with in this chapter has been pre-loaded for you, this time with a MultiIndex. Explore it in the IPython Shell to see the data layout. Pay attention to the index, and notice that the index levels are ['city', 'weekday']. So 'weekday' - the second entry - has position 1. This position is what corresponds to the level parameter in .stack() and .unstack() calls. Alternatively, you can specify 'weekday' as the level instead of its position.

Your job in this exercise is to unstack users by 'weekday'. You will then use .stack() on the unstacked DataFrame to see if you get back the original layout of users.

Stacking & unstacking II
You are now going to continue working with the users DataFrame. As always, first explore it in the IPython Shell to see the layout and note the index.

Your job in this exercise is to unstack and then stack the 'city' level, as you did previously for 'weekday'. Note that you won't get the same DataFrame.

Restoring the index order
Continuing from the previous exercise, you will now use .swaplevel(0, 1) to flip the index levels. Note they won't be sorted. To sort them, you will have to follow up with a .sort_index(). You will then obtain the original DataFrame. Note that an unsorted index leads to slicing failures.

To begin, print both users and bycity in the IPython Shell. The goal here is to convert bycity back to something that looks like users.

Adding names for readability
You are now going to practice melting DataFrames. A DataFrame called visitors_by_city_weekday has been pre-loaded for you. Explore it in the IPython Shell and see that it is the users DataFrame from previous exercises with the rows indexed by 'weekday', columns indexed by 'city', and values populated with 'visitors'.

Recall from the video that the goal of melting is to restore a pivoted DataFrame to its original form, or to change it from a wide shape to a long shape. You can explicitly specify the columns that should remain in the reshaped DataFrame with id_vars, and list which columns to convert into values with value_vars. As Dhavide demonstrated, if you don't pass a name to the values in pd.melt(), you will lose the name of your variable. You can fix this by using the value_name keyword argument.

Your job in this exercise is to melt visitors_by_city_weekday to move the city names from the column labels to values in a single column called 'city'. If you were to use just pd.melt(visitors_by_city_weekday), you would obtain the following result:

      city value
0  weekday   Mon
1  weekday   Sun
2   Austin   326
3   Austin   139
4   Dallas   456
5   Dallas   237
Therefore, you have to specify the id_vars keyword argument to ensure that 'weekday' is retained in the reshaped DataFrame, and the value_name keyword argument to change the name of value to visitors.

Instructions
100 XP
Reset the index of visitors_by_city_weekday with .reset_index().
Print visitors_by_city_weekday and verify that you have just a range index, 0, 1, 2, 3. This has been done for you.
Melt visitors_by_city_weekday to move the city names from the column labels to values in a single column called visitors.
Print visitors to check that the city values are in a single column now and that the dataframe is longer and skinnier.

# Reset the index: visitors_by_city_weekday
visitors_by_city_weekday = visitors_by_city_weekday.reset_index()

# Print visitors_by_city_weekday
print(visitors_by_city_weekday)

# Melt visitors_by_city_weekday: visitors
visitors = pd.melt(visitors_by_city_weekday, id_vars=['weekday'], value_name='visitors')

# Print visitors
print(visitors)


<script.py> output:
    city weekday  Austin  Dallas
    0        Mon     326     456

    3     Sun  Dallas       237

Going from wide to long
You can move multiple columns into a single column (making the data long and skinny) by "melting" multiple columns. In this exercise, you will practice doing this.

The users DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you. As always, explore it in the IPython Shell and note the index.

Instructions
100 XP
Define a DataFrame skinny where you melt the 'visitors' and 'signups' columns of users into a single column.
Print skinny to verify the results. Note the value column that had the cell values in users.

# Melt users: skinny
skinny = pd.melt(users,id_vars=['weekday' ,'city'])

# Print skinny
print(skinny)

<script.py> output:
      weekday    city  variable  value
    0     Sun  Austin  visitors    139
    1     Sun  Dallas  visitors    237

    Obtaining key-value pairs with melt()
Sometimes, all you need is some key-value pairs, and the context does not matter. If said context is in the index, you can easily obtain what you want. For example, in the users DataFrame, the visitors and signups columns lend themselves well to being represented as key-value pairs. So if you created a hierarchical index with 'city' and 'weekday' columns as the index, you can easily extract key-value pairs for the 'visitors' and 'signups' columns by melting users and specifying col_level=0.

Instructions
100 XP
Set the index of users to ['city', 'weekday'].
Print the DataFrame users_idx to see the new index.
Obtain the key-value pairs corresponding to visitors and signups by melting users_idx with the keyword argument col_level=0.


    # Set the new index: users_idx
users_idx = users.set_index(['city','weekday'])

# Print the users_idx DataFrame
print(users_idx)

# Obtain the key-value pairs: kv_pairs
kv_pairs = pd.melt(users_idx, col_level=0)

# Print the key-value pairs
print(kv_pairs)

    Setting up a pivot table
Recall from the video that a pivot table allows you to see all of your variables as a function of two other variables. In this exercise, you will use the .pivot_table() method to see how the users DataFrame entries appear when presented as functions of the 'weekday' and 'city' columns. That is, with the rows indexed by 'weekday' and the columns indexed by 'city'.

Before using the pivot table, print the users DataFrame in the IPython Shell and observe the layout.

Instructions
100 XP
Use a pivot table to index the rows of users by 'weekday' and the columns of users by 'city'. These correspond to the index and columns parameters of .pivot_table().

    Using other aggregations in pivot tables
You can also use aggregation functions within a pivot table by specifying the aggfunc parameter. In this exercise, you will practice using the 'count' and len aggregation functions - which produce the same result - on the users DataFrame.

Instructions

# Use a pivot table to display the count of each column: count_by_weekday1
count_by_weekday1 = users.pivot_table(index='weekday',aggfunc='count')

# Print count_by_weekday
print(count_by_weekday1)

# Replace 'aggfunc='count'' with 'aggfunc=len': count_by_weekday2
count_by_weekday2 = users.pivot_table(index='weekday',aggfunc=len)

# Verify that the same result is obtained

Using margins in pivot tables
Sometimes it's useful to add totals in the margins of a pivot table. You can do this with the argument margins=True. In this exercise, you will practice using margins in a pivot table along with a new aggregation function: sum.

Grouping data

In this chapter, you'll learn how to identify and split DataFrames by groups or categories for further aggregation or analysis. You'll also learn how to transform and filter your data, including how to detect outliers and impute missing values. Knowing how to effectively group data in pandas can be a seriously powerful addition to your data science toolbox.

Grouping by multiple columns
In this exercise, you will return to working with the Titanic dataset from Chapter 1 and use .groupby() to analyze the distribution of passengers who boarded the Titanic.

The 'pclass' column identifies which class of ticket was purchased by the passenger and the 'embarked' column indicates at which of the three ports the passenger boarded the Titanic. 'S' stands for Southampton, England, 'C' for Cherbourg, France and 'Q' for Queenstown, Ireland.

Your job is to first group by the 'pclass' column and count the number of rows in each class using the 'survived' column. You will then group by the 'embarked' and 'pclass' columns and count the number of passengers.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded as titanic.

Instructions
100 XP
Group by the 'pclass' column and save the result as by_class.
Aggregate the 'survived' column of by_class using .count(). Save the result as count_by_class.
Print count_by_class. This has been done for you.
Group titanic by the 'embarked' and 'pclass' columns. Save the result as by_mult.
Aggregate the 'survived' column of by_mult using .count(). Save the result as count_mult.
Print count_mult. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to view the result.


# Group titanic by 'pclass'
by_class = titanic.groupby('pclass')

Grouping by another series
In this exercise, you'll use two data sets from Gapminder.org to investigate the average life expectancy (in years) at birth in 2010 for the 6 continental regions. To do this you'll read the life expectancy data per country into one pandas DataFrame and the association between country and region into another.

By setting the index of both DataFrames to the country name, you'll then use the region information to group the countries in the life expectancy DataFrame and compute the mean value for 2010.

The life expectancy CSV file is available to you in the variable life_fname and the regions filename is available in the variable regions_fname.

Read life_fname into a DataFrame called life and set the index to 'Country'.
Read regions_fname into a DataFrame called regions and set the index to 'Country'.
Group life by the region column of regions and store the result in life_by_region.
Print the mean over the 2010 column of life_by_region.


# Read life_fname into a DataFrame: life
life = pd.read_csv(life_fname, index_col='Country')

# Read regions_fname into a DataFrame: regions

    Computing multiple aggregates of multiple columns
The .agg() method can be used with a tuple or list of aggregations as input. When applying multiple aggregations on multiple columns, the aggregated DataFrame has a multi-level column index.

In this exercise, you're going to group passengers on the Titanic by 'pclass' and aggregate the 'age' and 'fare' columns by the functions 'max' and 'median'. You'll then use multi-level selection to find the oldest passenger per class and the median fare price per class.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded as titanic.

Group titanic by 'pclass' and save the result as by_class.
Select the 'age' and 'fare' columns from by_class and save the result as by_class_sub.
Aggregate by_class_sub using 'max' and 'median'. You'll have to pass 'max' and 'median' in the form of a list to .agg().
Use .loc[] to print all of the rows and the column specification ('age','max'). This has been done for you.
Use .loc[] to print all of the rows and the column specification ('fare','median').

# Group titanic by 'pclass': by_class
by_class = titanic.groupby('pclass')

Aggregating on index levels/fields
If you have a DataFrame with a multi-level row index, the individual levels can be used to perform the groupby. This allows advanced aggregation techniques to be applied along one or more levels in the index and across one or more columns.

In this exercise you'll use the full Gapminder dataset which contains yearly values of life expectancy, population, child mortality (per 1,000) and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) for every country in the world from 1964 to 2013.

Your job is to create a multi-level DataFrame of the columns 'Year', 'Region' and 'Country'. Next you'll group the DataFrame by the 'Year' and 'Region' levels. Finally, you'll apply a dictionary aggregation to compute the total population, spread of per capita GDP values and average child mortality rate.

The Gapminder CSV file is available as 'gapminder.csv'.

Instructions

Read 'gapminder.csv' into a DataFrame with index_col=['Year','region','Country']. Sort the index.
Group gapminder with a level of ['Year','region'] using its level parameter. Save the result as by_year_region.
Define the function spread which returns the maximum and minimum of an input series. This has been done for you.
Create a dictionary with 'population':'sum', 'child_mortality':'mean' and 'gdp':spread as aggregator. This has been done for you.
Use the aggregator dictionary to aggregate by_year_region. Save the result as aggregated.
Print the last 6 entries of aggregated. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to view the result.


   # Read the CSV file into a DataFrame and sort the index: gapminder
gapminder = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv', index_col=['Year','region','Country']).sort_index()

by_year_region = gapminder.groupby(level=['Year','region'])

# Define the function to compute spread: spread
def spread(series):
    return series.max() - series.min()

# Create the dictionary: aggregator
aggregator = {'population':'sum', 'child_mortality':'mean', 'gdp':spread}

   Grouping on a function of the index
Groupby operations can also be performed on transformations of the index values. In the case of a DateTimeIndex, we can extract portions of the datetime over which to group.

In this exercise you'll read in a set of sample sales data from February 2015 and assign the 'Date' column as the index. Your job is to group the sales data by the day of the week and aggregate the sum of the 'Units' column.

Is there a day of the week that is more popular for customers? To find out, you're going to use .strftime('%a') to transform the index datetime values to abbreviated days of the week.

The sales data CSV file is available to you as 'sales.csv'.

Instructions
100 XP
Read 'sales.csv' into a DataFrame with index_col='Date' and parse_dates=True.
Create a groupby object with sales.index.strftime('%a') as input and assign it to by_day.
Aggregate the 'Units' column of by_day with the .sum() method. Save the result as units_sum.
Print units_sum. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result.


# Read file: sales
sales = pd.read_csv('sales.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)

# Create a groupby object: by_day
by_day = sales.groupby(sales.index.strftime('%a'))

# Create sum: units_sum
units_sum = by_day['Units'].sum()

# Print units_sum
print(units_sum)

Detecting outliers with Z-Scores
As Dhavide demonstrated in the video using the zscore function, you can apply a .transform() method after grouping to apply a function to groups of data independently. The z-score is also useful to find outliers: a z-score value of +/- 3 is generally considered to be an outlier.

In this example, you're going to normalize the Gapminder data in 2010 for life expectancy and fertility by the z-score per region. Using boolean indexing, you will filter out countries that have high fertility rates and low life expectancy for their region.

The Gapminder DataFrame for 2010 indexed by 'Country' is provided for you as gapminder_2010.

    Filling missing data (imputation) by group
Many statistical and machine learning packages cannot determine the best action to take when missing data entries are encountered. Dealing with missing data is natural in pandas (both in using the default behavior and in defining a custom behavior). In Chapter 1, you practiced using the .dropna() method to drop missing values. Now, you will practice imputing missing values. You can use .groupby() and .transform() to fill missing data appropriately for each group.

Your job is to fill in missing 'age' values for passengers on the Titanic with the median age from their 'gender' and 'pclass'. To do this, you'll group by the 'sex' and 'pclass' columns and transform each group with a custom function to call .fillna() and impute the median value.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded as titanic. Explore it in the IPython Shell by printing the output of titanic.tail(10). Notice in particular the NaNs in the 'age' column.

Other transformations with .apply
The .apply() method when used on a groupby object performs an arbitrary function on each of the groups. These functions can be aggregations, transformations or more complex workflows. The .apply() method will then combine the results in an intelligent way.

In this exercise, you're going to analyze economic disparity within regions of the world using the Gapminder data set for 2010. To do this you'll define a function to compute the aggregate spread of per capita GDP in each region and the individual country's z-score of the regional per capita GDP. You'll then select three countries - United States, Great Britain and China - to see a summary of the regional GDP and that country's z-score against the regional mean.

The 2010 Gapminder DataFrame is provided for you as gapminder_2010. Pandas has been imported as pd.

The following function has been defined for your use:

def disparity(gr):
    # Compute the spread of gr['gdp']: s
    s = gr['gdp'].max() - gr['gdp'].min()
    # Compute the z-score of gr['gdp'] as (gr['gdp']-gr['gdp'].mean())/gr['gdp'].std(): z
    z = (gr['gdp'] - gr['gdp'].mean())/gr['gdp'].std()
    # Return a DataFrame with the inputs {'z(gdp)':z, 'regional spread(gdp)':s}
