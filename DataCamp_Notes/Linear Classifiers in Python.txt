Linear Classifiers in Python

Course Description
In this course you'll learn all about using linear classifiers, specifically logistic regression and support vector machines, with scikit-learn. Once you've learned how to apply these methods, you'll dive into the ideas behind them and find out what really makes them tick. At the end of this course you'll know how to train, test, and tune these linear classifiers in Python. You'll also have a conceptual foundation for understanding many other machine learning algorithms.
